🚀 Snort Intrusion Detection System

📌 Project Overview

Snort is an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) created by Martin Roesch in 1998. It analyzes network traffic against predefined rules to identify potential security threats. With its powerful protocol analysis and flexible rule configuration, Snort is widely used to protect networks from cyber threats.

🎯 Objectives

Attack Detection: Identify common cyber attacks like port scans, DoS, SQL injection, and malware communication patterns.
Real-Time Alerting: Notify administrators instantly upon detecting suspicious activities.
Logging and Event Recording: Store detailed event information, including IP addresses, timestamps, and attack types, for further analysis.

🛠️ Features
Protocol Analysis: Detects anomalies in packet structures to identify malicious activities.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works seamlessly across multiple operating systems, including Linux and Windows.
Customizable Rules: Configure detection rules to meet specific network security needs.

🧩 Snort Architecture
Packet Decoder: Captures network packets for analysis.
Preprocessor: Normalizes packet data and prepares it for rule inspection.
Detection Engine: Matches packets against predefined rules to detect threats.
Logging and Alerting: Records event details and sends real-time alerts.

⚙️ Rules Structure
Header Rule: Specifies protocol, source/destination IP, and ports.
Option Rule: Defines additional conditions, like TCP flags or IP headers.
Metadata Rule: Includes extra information such as author and references.
Content Rule: Checks packet payloads for specific patterns or signatures.
